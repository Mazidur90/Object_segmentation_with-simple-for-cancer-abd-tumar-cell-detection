# problem: General Researchers in a Medical institute want to examine, different cancer and tumar cells. They have the data from the medical center but now it requires much more time to evaluate single x ray images as they have do it
manually_therefore they ask their Technical intern to come up with a solution to automate the process ina way that they will get images with specific colours thet will indicate which cells are affected by cancer

# Technical_intern( Mazidur): I will make an application in python with YOLOV8 ultralytics architecture model, that will produce accurate segmentation model with different colours and give you guys the resulted image for your use 
producing thousands of detection and segmentation at a same time! you can do rel time detction just by mouting a camera and an rasberry pi for real time detection under your microscope to your computer screen.

Application description: This is a classical image processing problem where the xray images with cancer and tumor cells has to be fed in the architecture and train it for dtection and segmentation for further segmntation of 
tumar cells. Previously this problems were handled by CV2 aka open cv. but ultralytics is considered to be the  bestgarchitecture for model training as it is new and  more accurate
